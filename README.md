# Bank-system-security-lock
In the bank, a security lock is used to access some rooms. This lock accepts two inputs: the
employee identification number (16 bits) and his/her password (4 bits). If the bank has 20
employees, construct their database and store it in the memory. Then write a program to
access these rooms.
The inputs of the program are the employee identification and the password.
The output is one bit (0/1) that means (denied/allowed).
